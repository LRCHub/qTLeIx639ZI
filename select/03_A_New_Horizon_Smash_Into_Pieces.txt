You went too far when I was the star in a lullaby (a lullaby)
And every scar keep telling my heart we are over now (we're over now)

You, you can't follow me through
Through with all that is you
You are out of play, e-ey

I'm over the stars and far away
My imagination leads the way
I'm letting the darkness fade away
To a new horizon (new horizon)
(New, new, new) A new horizon (new horizon)

Don't want it slow, I'm down with the flow
Time for something new (for something new)
Not looking back 'cause I'm the new black
And you know it's true (you know it's true)

You, you can't follow me through
Through with all that is you
You are out of play, e-ey

I'm over the stars and far away
My imagination leads the way
I'm letting the darkness fade away
To a new horizon (new horizon)

I'm over the stars and far away
And I'm waking up to a better day
I'm letting the darkness fade away
To a new horizon (new horizon)
(New, new, new) A new horizon (new horizon)

I'm over the stars and far away
My imagination leads the way
I'm letting the darkness fade away
To a new horizon (new horizon)

I'm over the stars and far away
And I'm waking up to a better day
I'm letting the darkness fade away
To a new horizon (new horizon)
(New, new, new) A new horizon (new horizon)
