It's been the longest time since
I have seen the light
And while I'm glad to be with
you
I'm tired of the night
Would you agree with me tonight
That it's time to let me go
I'm ready now for so much more!
Goodbye everyone
I'm finally free again
For new adventure
My trials are done
This feeling across my mind
I'll always remember
Goodbye everyone
The sun in the summer sky
Will take me onward
My life has begun
To fall in my hands again
To horizons yet unknown!
My deepest gratitude for
Telling me you care
But now I'm off to better things
Although I don't know where
Would you agree with me tonight
That it's time to let me go
I'm ready now for so much more!
Goodbye everyone
I'm finally free again
For new adventure
My trials are done
This feeling across my mind
I'll always remember
Goodbye everyone
The sun in the summer sky
Will take me onward
My life has begun
To fall in my hands again
To horizons yet unknown!
Would you agree with me tonight
That it's time to let me go
I'm ready now for so much more!
Goodbye everyone
I'm finally free again

My trials are done
This feeling across my mind
I'll always remember
Goodbye everyone
The sun in the summer sky
Will take me onward
My life has begun
To fall in my hands again
To horizons yet unknown!
I'm ready now for so much more!
Goodbye everyone
