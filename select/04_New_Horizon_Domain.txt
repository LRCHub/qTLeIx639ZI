I can't help thinkin' I nearly go insane
My mind keeps turning - can't stop my brain
Can't hold it back and I'm gonna be breaking away
I'm gonna pack my bags and get out of this place
Gonna leave those worries behind me
No looking back and I'm gonna be hindin' away

And if you ask me why I don't wanna stay
Why I'm not tryin' to get it on some way
And if you tell me you'll miss me when I'm gone
I just can't keep holdin' on

I will fly though love is gone
Way up high - no need to compromise
Ain't gonna die if the battle's lost or won
Aim for a new horizon
I'll be free - gonna touch the clouds
I still believe that love can last forever
Now I know that I gotta make this change just for myself
And aim for a new horizon

Can't hold it baby - I got to break away
Can't stay no longer - no time to waste
Aim for the heart and you're gonna be blessed with love

I will fly though love is gone
Way up high - no need to compromise
Ain't gonna die if the battle's lost or won
Aim for a new horizon
I'll be free - gonna touch the clouds
I still believe that love can last forever
Now I know that I gotta make this change just for myself
And aim for a new horizon

It may be hard but I gotta ramble on
This is my own life - I gotta keep going on
You've had your chances - you lied into my face
This change is my hiding place

I will fly though love is gone
Way up high - no need to compromise
Ain't gonna die if the battle's lost or won
Aim for a new horizon
I'll be free - gonna touch the clouds
I still believe that love can last forever
Now I know that I gotta make this change just for myself
And aim for a new horizon
